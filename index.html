    <p>Escape from Tarkov is a player vs player game. When playing you can form teams up to 4 players. There are many different maps you can chose from before you go in a raid. You will also select a time of day or night. There are two times of day you can pick. The one you pick will be the time of day your raid is. The amount of time you wait for the raid to start is based of the time of day you pick. There for if you pick a time at night you will wait longer because less people play at night.</p>

    <p>Before you select what map you want to play on you need to chose a character. The one on the left is your Scav. The Scav is more for making money and to do the little challenges with. The one thing you have to wait is the for is the cool down the scav has after you come back from a raid. The one on the right is your pmc. The pmc is more important because its your main character. The items you take in raid as a pmc are lost if you die, Unless you insure your items which cost money so normally people dont unless they have a really good gun with good attachments.Thats why your pmc is more for challenges. Both charcters have their strong suits on each map. Some maps mostly Scavs play on so Pmc's avoide it</p>

    <p>This is your hide out its very important if you want to progress in the game. Every time you go into a raid you will find items to upgrade your hide out. There are many different things to upgrade. To progress throught the game you need to upgrade you hide out, its not an option its a must because there are many benefits tha might just save you when playing. Like I mentioned before the Scav has a cool down before you can use it again, there is an upgrade to lower the time you have to wait. Thats why your hide out is super important to upgrade, the benefits are way too good to miss out on.</p>
