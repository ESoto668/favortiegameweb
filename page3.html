    <p>The flea market unlocks when you hit level 15. You can buy and sell things on the flea market. This is one way to get the most money for the items you sell. The way to sell something quickly is too price your item a little less then the middle price. People will go for the cheapest item possible. The flea market is one of the best ways to make money fast. You can buy almost any item off the flea market, and some of the items you will need so people price them at super high price.</p>
